Mini-Max Algorithm:-
Introduction:
The minimax algorithm is a widely used approach for creating an artificial 
intelligence (AI) opponent in games like Tic Tac Toe. This algorithm allows the AI 
to evaluate all possible moves and choose the optimal one, maximizing its 
chances of winning or minimizing the opponent's chances. In this short note, 
we will provide an overview of implementing the minimax algorithm for Tic Tac 
Toe in Java.
Algorithm Overview:
1. Create a recursive function, let's call it `minimax`, that takes the current 
game state, depth, and maximizing player as inputs.
2. If the game has reached a terminal state (win, loss, or draw), return the 
evaluation score based on the outcome (positive for a win, negative for a loss, 
and 0 for a draw).
3. If the maximizing player is the current player, initialize the best score to 
negative infinity. Iterate through each possible move:
 a. Make the move in the game state.
 b. Recursively call the `minimax` function with the updated game state, 
increased depth, and the opposing player as the maximizing player.
 c. Update the best score if the returned score is higher.
 d. Undo the move.
4. If the maximizing player is not the current player, initialize the best score to 
positive infinity. Iterate through each possible move and follow the same 
process as in step 3, but update the best score if the returned score is lower.
5. Return the best score found at the current depth.
 
Integration with Tic Tac Toe:-
1. Represent the Tic Tac Toe board using array or any suitable data structure.
2. Implement a function to generate all possible moves given the current board 
state.
3. In the main game loop, when it is the AI's turn, call the `minimax` function 
for each possible move and choose the move with the highest score as the AI's 
next move.
4. Apply the chosen move to the game state and continue the game.
Conclusion:
The minimax algorithm provides a powerful method for creating AI opponents 
in games like Tic Tac Toe. By evaluating all possible moves and choosing the 
optimal one, the AI can make strategic decisions and pose a challenge to 
human players. Implementing this algorithm in Java requires careful 
consideration of game state representation, move generation, and integrating 
it into the game logic. With a well-implemented minimax algorithm, you can 
enhance the gameplay experience and create a more competitive AI opponent 
in Tic Tac Toe
